IT635-Database Administration 

Database Project

This project is based on the healthcare field and specifically about the pharmaceutical field. I want to create a database for pharmacies where they can on the front-end side enter a specific name of medicine and get the information for that medicine. The information that they can retrieve is where the medicine is located in the pharmacy like the aisle or section, as well as the count of that medicine that is in stock. 

I am choosing this field because there are many times when pharmacies run out of medicines and have to order it and in that mean time there are people who need medicines and the concern is that if there are people who have to take those medicines then what happens to them. So, in order to solve the problem they can even set up a minimum number of medicine that they need to have. One has to be really careful when it comes to health and so this database can help pharmacies a lot to keep track of the amount of medicines they have.
